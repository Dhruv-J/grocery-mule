## What is GroceryMule?
Living in our own apartments for the first time since coming back to campus pos COVID-19, we realized how messy doing groceries can be. From figuring out everyone's shopping list to splitting the bill afterwards, shopping for roommates can be a hassle. That's why we created GroceryMule, a cross platform mobile app that streamlines the group grocery shopping experience.

## Features 
GroceryMule makes it easier to do groceries for other people and get paid back on time. With GroceryMule, you'll be able to:
* Create realtime collaborative shopping lists üìù ‚úÖ
* Scan in your receipt using your smartphone camera üì∏ üßæ
* Get accurate totals for every person in your group üíµ 

## Techstack
GroceryMule is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and uses Google's NoSQL [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview/)  database to provide users a seamless, realtime experience. Our motivation behind using a Google development suite was the extra security it offered our users as well as easy integration of 3rd party sign-in.
